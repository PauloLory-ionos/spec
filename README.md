# Sovereign European Cloud API - Guidance

In the modern landscape of cloud computing, APIs serve as the backbone for enabling seamless integration between services, applications, and platforms. When designing and developing APIs for the cloud, itâ€™s essential to focus on scalability, security, and flexibility to support a wide range of client applications. This chapter provides comprehensive guidelines on how to design robust, scalable cloud APIs that align with industry best practices.

In this chapter we aim to cover key principles such as RESTful architecture, API versioning, backward compatibility, and security considerations, along with strategies to design cloud resources. Whether building APIs for internal use or exposing them to third-party developers, these practices will help create APIs that are easy to use, maintain, and evolve over time.
