  The Authorization API provides access to authorization resources
  that are shared across all tenants and workspaces in all regions.
  This API is part of the Sovereign European Cloud API.
resources:
  - name: role
    plural: roles
    hierarchy: [tenant]
    schema: ./schemas/rbac.yaml#/Role
    operations: [list, get, put, delete]
    description:
      put: |
        System roles (ADMIN, WORKSPACE_ADMIN, WORKSPACE_EDITOR, WORKSPACE_VIEWER) cannot be modified.
      delete: |
        Deletes the specified role. When a role is deleted:
        - The role is removed from all role assignments
        - Role assignments are NOT deleted, even if the role array becomes empty
        - System roles (ADMIN, WORKSPACE_ADMIN, WORKSPACE_EDITOR, WORKSPACE_VIEWER) cannot be deleted
  - name: role assignment
    plural: role assignments
    hierarchy: [tenant]
    schema: ./schemas/rbac.yaml#/RoleAssignment
    operations: [list, get, put, delete]
    description:
      get: |
        Retrieves the details of a specific role assignment group by its name
      put: |
        Replaces all role assignments for the specified group within the workspace.
        At least one role must be assigned.
        Note: Role assignments can be created with an empty role array,
        which effectively removes all roles from the group while maintaining
        the role assignment record.
      delete: |
        Deletes the specified role assignment group within the workspace.
        This removes the entire group and all its associated role assignments.
