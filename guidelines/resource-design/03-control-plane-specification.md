## **Control Plane Specification**

Control Plan APIs have all the following template:

```bash
`https://{service}.{domain}/{scope}/providers/{resourceProviderworkspace}/{resourceType}[/{resourceName}][/{action}]?api-version={api-version}[&{queryStringParameters}]`
```


| Parameter | Description |
|---------- | ----------- |
| service   | Name of the cloud service, ”api” in our case |
| domain    | Cloud Service Provider domain name (ad es. aruba.it, arubacloud.com, etc.) |
| scope    | A hierarchical set of key-value pairs that identify the origin of the resource. <br/> Scopes answer questions like: “What cloud account contains this resource?<br/>"Which department or organizational unit this resource belongs to ?"<br/>"What logical group this resource belongs to ?"<br/>|
| resourceProviderworkspace    | The workspace and type of a resource. These are defined together because resource types are usually two segments - a vendor workspace and a type name. For example Aruba.Compute. Each Resource is managed by a Resource Provider. The implementation of Resource Provider is CSP specific. A single Resource Provider can manage multiple resource types|
| resourceType    | The type of Resource|
| resourceName    | The name of the Resource. Sub-resources are allowed. They follow the parent resource in the URL path|
