## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for designing and implementing control plane APIs for the **Sovereign European Cloud API (SECA)** initiative, establishing a consistent standard to ensure a high-quality developer experience and robust cloud resource management. 

These standards focus on achieving:

**Developer-Friendly Interfaces**: By following consistent patterns and widely accepted web standards (HTTP, REST, JSON), these APIs facilitate ease of use and seamless integration.

**Efficient, Reliable Operations**: Built with scalability in mind, these APIs are designed to support reliable, fault-tolerant applications through idempotency, retries, and version control mechanisms.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to be accessible via SDKs in multiple programming languages, enabling a broad range of development environments.

**Future-Proofing and Stability**: Through clear API contracts and versioning practices, these guidelines ensure that customer workloads remain stable and backward-compatible, even as the APIs evolve.

In a rapidly evolving technology landscape, this document serves as a living reference, adaptable to new ideas and ongoing improvements to meet the evolving needs of developers and cloud consumers.
