        - updating: available for data layer usage
        - deleting: maybe still available for data layer user, can fail any moment
        - suspended: not available, provider specific behavior (payment issue, user decided to suspend)

          LastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one
          status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.
          If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is
          acceptable.
      reason:
        type: string
        description: |
          The reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase.
