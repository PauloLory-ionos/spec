SecurityGroup:
  type: object
  description: |
    A Security Group defines network access rules for a group of compute instances.
    
    Key Concepts:
    - Rules define bi-directional or uni-directional network communication
    - Supports routing between security groups
    - Enables granular control over public internet access
    - Implements stateful connection tracking
    
    Connection Tracking:
    When a connection is initiated from an allowed source, return traffic is automatically permitted,
    even if not explicitly defined in the rules. This ensures seamless, bi-directional communication
    for established connections.
    
    Routing and Communication Patterns:
    - Group-to-Group Rules: Define explicit communication paths between security groups
    - PublicInternet Target: Allows precise control over internet-facing traffic
    - Ingress/Egress Control: Fine-grained rules for incoming and outgoing traffic

            Rule Evaluation:
            - Rules are processed in order of priority (lower number = higher priority)
            - First matching rule determines the action (allow/deny)
            - Default behavior is to deny all traffic not explicitly allowed
